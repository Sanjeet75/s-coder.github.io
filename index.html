                <p class="lead">“A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying ﬁrst a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer
                    programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren’t ﬂexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.” <br> Feature Flags are a software development technique that allows us to control
                    the release of features independent of code deployment. This allows us to iterate quicker; testing features before they are complete to reduce risk and increase flow." <br> For computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other similar electronic
                    devices to work, a programming language is necessary that tells them the commands and allows them to complete different activities. There are several types and features of programming languages depending on their philosophy and objectives.</p>

                <p class="lead">A programming language consists of a vocabulary containing a set of grammatical
                    rules
                    intended to convey instructions to a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.

                    Each programming language has a unique set of keywords along with a special syntax to organize
                    the
                    software’s instructions.

                    There are low-level and high-level programming languages which, although simple compared to
                    human
                    languages, are more complex than machine languages. <br>
                    Low-level languages include assembly and machine languages. An assembly language contains a list
                    of
                    basic instructions and is much harder to read than a high-level language.

                    High-level languages, on the other hand, are designed to be easy to read and understand,
                    allowing
                    programmers to write source codes naturally, using logical words and symbols.
                    The following activities can be performed: <br>

                    > Programs and applications development. <br>
                    > Artificial intelligence development. <br>
                    > Database development.<br>

                    <p class="lead">A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how
                        to
                        function. A developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such a
                        way
                        that end users have no difficulty navigating the site. The website should not be so simple that
                        it
                        does not appeal to advanced users, nor should it be so complicated that the beginner is easily
                        lost
                        in the process.

                        Web development can be divided into three parts: code that executes in a web browser and
                        determines
                        what customers or clients will see when they land on a website (client-side scripting); code
                        that
                        executes on a web server and powers the behind-the-scenes mechanics of how a website works
                        (server-side scripting); and database technology, which helps to keep a website running smoothly
                        and
                        efficiently. Large-scale web projects often divide these tasks among multiple web developers.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        When it comes to technology, there are plenty of career paths one can take. One area that has
                        seen an incredible rise in popularity is that of app development. There are literally millions
                        of apps available today, from music apps to banking apps. that help people perform specific
                        tasks.

                        An app developer is a computer software engineer whose primary responsibilities include
                        creating, testing and programming apps for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. These
                        developers typically work in teams, and think of ideas and concepts either for the general
                        public, or for a specific customer need.

                        App developers understand coding languages and how to use them, and may also work alongside
                        graphic artists, data scientists, and other software experts to create applications. They also
                        test and fix any bugs that are found before the product is launched.

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other similar
                            electronic devices to work, a programming language is necessary that tells them the
                            commands and allows them to complete different activities. There are several types and
                            features of programming languages depending on their philosophy and objectives.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout this post, we will reveal a detailed
                            classification of programming languages, with their features and differences that
                            distinguish them from each other. In addition, you will discover which is the best
                            language for web programming. Are you ready? There is no time to lose. </span></p>
                    <h2>What is a programming language?</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programming language consists of a vocabulary containing a
                            set of grammatical rules intended to convey instructions to a computer or computing
                            device to perform specific tasks. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each programming language has a unique set of keywords along
                            with a special syntax to organize the software’s instructions.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are low-level and high-level programming languages
                            which, although simple compared to human languages, are more complex than machine
                            languages. </span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-level languages include assembly and machine languages.
                            An assembly language contains a list of basic instructions and is much harder to read
                            than a high-level language.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-level languages, on the other hand, are designed to be
                            easy to read and understand, allowing programmers to write source codes naturally, using
                            logical words and symbols.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the evolution of computers, hundreds of different
                            programming languages have been created for various types of development. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of programming is very wide, so the use of a
                            particular language will depend on the objectives to be achieved. Logical, isn’t
                            it?</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following activities can be performed:</span></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programs and applications

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Differences between natural language and programming language</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural language is the language spoken by people, while
                            programming language is intended for machines. Both languages present important
                            similarities, such as the differentiation they make between syntax and semantics, their
                            purpose to communicate and the existence of a basic composition on both.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, there are several similarities and points
                            in common, for example, the two types were created to communicate ideas, expressions,
                            and instructions. However, it is also possible to identify some differences.</span></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the differences between natural language and
                            programming language, it is worth noting that the latter is stricter and less tolerant
                            than the former. This happens because human languages have a built-in redundancy that
                            allows some ambiguity to be resolved using context. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, programming languages have practically no
                            redundancy, otherwise, it would be very easy to fall into ambiguity and not indicate the
                            correct command. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that programming languages are stricter in this
                            regard is due to the fact that computers are very precise in the instructions they like
                            to receive. In addition, machines do not have the ability to clarify the meaning of an
                            expression as a human being would.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also essential that programming languages are fixed and
                            closed to avoid confusion, while natural languages are open and allow combinations
                            without the risk of making mistakes.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of these circumstances, programming languages are
                            designed from the ground up by talented developers focused on not ruining the various
                            functionalities, whether it’s controlling a robot, medical equipment, space machines or
                            a Facebook game, for instance.</span></p>
                    <h3><strong>Main features of programming languages</strong></h3>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of a programming language depends on the
                            features and utilities it provides to programmers. The features that a programming
                            language must have to stand out are the following: </span></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Simplicity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the
                                language must offer clear and simple concepts that facilitate its learning and
                                application, in a way that is simple to understand and maintain. Simplicity does not
                                mean that it can be subtracted from the optimal power of functioning. </span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Naturalness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: this means
                                that its application in the area for which it was designed must be done naturally,
                                providing operators, structures and syntax for operators to work efficiently.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Abstraction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: it is the
                                ability to define and use complicated structures or operations while ignoring some
                                details, which influences writing ability.</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Programming
                                languages must be translated and executed efficiently so as not to take up too much
                                memory space or require too much time.</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Structuring</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the
                                language allows programmers to write their codes according to structured programming
                                concepts, to avoid creating errors.</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Compactness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: with this
                                characteristic, it is possible to express operations concisely, without having to
                                write too many details. </span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Locality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: refers to the
                                codes concentrating on the part of the program with which you are working at a given
                                time.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3><strong>What is the best web programming language?</strong></h3>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development can be done through different programming
                            languages that allow you to build a site or design an application. Defining which is the
                            best web programming language is complicated because it depends on several factors.
                            However, the following options stand out: </span></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Java:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multipurpose
                                language that adjusts efficiently to web development. </span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Go:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a general
                                purpose, flexible language that facilitates the creation of applications. </span>
                        </li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ruby on Rails:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows
                                you to design web applications quickly.</span></li>

                        <h2>What is a Web Developer?</h2>
                        <p>A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to
                            function. A developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such
                            a way that end users have no difficulty navigating the site. The website should not be so
                            simple that it does not appeal to advanced users, nor should it be so complicated that the
                            beginner is easily lost in the process. </p>
                        <p>Web development can be divided into three parts: code that executes in a web browser and
                            determines what customers or clients will see when they land on a website (client-side
                            scripting); code that executes on a web server and powers the behind-the-scenes mechanics of
                            how a website works (server-side scripting); and database technology, which helps to keep a
                            website running smoothly and efficiently. Large-scale web projects often divide these tasks
                            among multiple web developers.</p>

                        <p>A web developer builds and maintains websites with the client and consumer in mind. That is,
                            the end design must include products and services offered and show how users may access
                            these. For example, a customer may want a form to capture an end user’s e-mail to request
                            additional information, provide a newsletter, or thank a customer for their business. </p>
                        <p>One type of developer may focus on setting up the back end of a site (back-end developer)
                            while another may focus on the client side to add style and functionality to the website
                            itself (front-end developer).</p>
                        <p>The work is typically very project-focused and involves collaborating with a team of people
                            who help coordinate the client's needs with the end product. Work may include meeting with
                            clients to discuss their needs and requirements for a website or discuss how to keep their
                            website functioning and up-to-date. Web developers typically construct the layout of a
                            website, creating a visually interesting home page and user-friendly design, and may
                            sometimes write content for the website. After a website is up and running, developers make
                            sure that the site is functional on all web browsers, testing and updating as needed. </p>
                        <p>Web developers are familiar with technology and understand how computers and web servers
                            operate. They are also very familiar with many software programs, web applications and web
                            programming languages, such as hypertext markup language (HTML), JavaScript (JS), Ruby on
                            Rails, and C++. They must be able to communicate effectively, set goals and meet deadlines.

                        <h2>Types of Web Developers:</h2>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Front-End Developers</strong> - A
                            front-end developer is a web developer that codes the front end of a website. While web
                            design is the way a website looks, front end development is how that design actually gets
                            implemented on the web. </p>
                        <p><strong>Back-End Developers</strong> - A back-end
                            developer is someone who builds and maintains the technology needed to power the components
                            which enable the user-facing side of a website to exist. Their back end code adds utility to
                            everything the front-end designer creates. </p>
                        <p><strong>Full Stack Developers</strong> - Full
                            stack developers understand how every part of the web development process takes place and
                            can guide on strategy and best practices. These developers will have an increasingly
                            important role in the web development of the future, and are able to look at the 'big
                            picture'. They are knowledgeable with the server side as well as the client side’s user
                            experience. </p>
                        <p><strong>JavaScript Developers</strong> -
                            JavaScript (JS) is a type of web programming language that is supported across all web
                            browsers and tools, and is the language that gives JavaScript developers control and power
                            to create, enhance and modify websites. Even though a JavaScript developer typically works
                            on the front-end, the programming language itself is not limited to front-end use only.</p>

                                and expressive. They are unstructured, original, nonconforming, and innovative. Some of
                                them are also conventional, meaning they’re conscientious and conservative.

                        <p>When it comes to technology, there are plenty of career paths one can take. One area that has
                            seen an incredible rise in popularity is that of app development. There are literally
                            millions of apps available today, from music apps to banking apps. that help people perform
                            specific tasks. </p>
                        <p>An app developer is a computer software engineer whose primary responsibilities include
                            creating, testing and programming apps for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. These
                            developers typically work in teams, and think of ideas and concepts either for the general
                            public, or for a specific customer need.</p>
                        <p>App developers understand coding languages and how to use them, and may also work alongside
                            graphic artists, data scientists, and other software experts to create applications. They
                            also test and fix any bugs that are found before the product is launched.

                        <p>Applications software can be written for a particular operating system (OS), such as Android,
                            iOS or Windows. App developers typically specialize in a specific development area, such as
                            mobile phone applications, graphics software, accounting software, or office suites.</p>
                        <p>Marketing firms often conduct research in order to gather information relating to consumer
                            needs. This information is then passed on to app developers who create new applications that
                            meet the public's needs in terms of use and cost. Several versions are made of the same
                            basic application that can be read by different types of devices, such as cell phones,
                            tablets and personal computers. </p>
                        <p>Once an app is complete and goes into production, the app developer works on creating patches
                            (upgrades), that are periodically released to the public. App developers work for themselves
                            just as often as they work for small, medium and large sized companies, building ‘native’
                            experiences that allow people to complete tasks, consume content and interact with brands
                            and other people.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Job Skills and Requirements for App Developers: </p>
                        <p><strong>Analytical Skills</strong> - recognizing the needs of customers, and creating new
                            applications that answer those needs<br />
                            <strong>Communication</strong> - clearly communicating ideas to coders, teammates and
                            management<br />
                            <strong>Creativity</strong> - inventing new ways of handling problems and developing
                            innovative applications <br />
                            <strong>Customer Service</strong> - If dealing directly with clients and customers, having
                            excellent customer service skills to answer questions and fix issues<br />
                            <strong>Attention to Detail</strong> - having all parts of applications working together for
                            the application to function<br />
                            <strong>Problem-Solving</strong> - making decisions that move the project forward<br />
                            <strong>Teamwork</strong> - As part of a large team of developers, working well with
                            others<br />
                            <strong>Technical Skills</strong> - being adept in computer languages and having good
                            technical knowledge
                        </p>
                        <p>The following are three types of App Developers:</p>
                        <p><strong>Mobile App Developers</strong><br />
                            Smartphones and, more recently, tablets are increasingly becoming the computer of choice for
                            more and more people. Mobile app developers have specialized training in design for small
                            electronic equipment, and write computer programs for smartphones and other mobile devices.
                        </p>
                        <p>Instead of building for a larger PC screen, these developers are dealing with extremely small
                            Android, iPhone, or BlackBerry screens. They are experienced in multi-media applications and
                            multiple mobile computer programming languages. </p>
                        <p>Mobile app developers typically write programs using either objective C, C++, Python, or
                            Java. Each mobile device uses a specific programming language which app developers must
                            understand.</p>
                        <p><strong>Android Developers</strong><br />
                            Android is the name of the mobile operating system owned by Google. Android typically comes
                            installed on a variety of smartphones and tablets from many manufacturers such as Samsung,
                            Sony, and Motorola (as well as on Google's own Nexus smartphone), giving users access to
                            Google services such as Search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail, etc. </p>
                        <p>An android developer develops applications for use on phones and tablets that utilize the
                            android operating system - everything from interactive games to media players, to electronic
                            book readers and global navigation software. The code required for android development is
                            mostly open source and available freely for anyone interested in developing apps for use
                            with the Android OS. </p>
                        <p>It’s an exciting time to have a career in Android development. There is a healthy supply of
                            jobs, demand for Android apps is accelerating, and technology is advancing.</p>
                        <p><strong>iOS Developers</strong><br />
                            iOS is a shortened way of saying ‘iPhone OS’, or ‘iPhone Operating System’, and is the
                            mobile operating system that runs on Apple’s mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. </p>
                        <p>iOS developers build software – they know how to structure it, test it, debug it, and how to
                            use source control. iOS developers know Swift or Objective-C (and some know both languages,
                            which is best). </p>
                        <p>They know iOS, which means they have a good grasp on build views; can handle user
                            interaction; can display data; show alerts; handle navigation; display images, labels and
                            text views; and integrate with REST APIs and parse JSON.</p>
